////////////

Key Features:

    Cross-Browser Compatibility: Playwright offers a consistent API 
    for controlling web browsers, making it easier to write tests 
    that work across different platforms and browsers.

    Headless and Headful Testing: You can run tests in headless mode 
    (without a visible browser window) for faster execution or in 
    headful mode for visual inspection.

    Page Object Model (POM): Playwright supports the POM pattern, 
    which helps you organize your tests and make them more maintainable.

    Assertions: Playwright provides built-in assertions for verifying 
    the state of web pages, making it easy to write robust tests.

    Network Interception: You can intercept network requests and 
    responses to simulate network conditions or modify data.

    Mobile Emulation: Playwright allows you to emulate mobile 
    devices and their specific characteristics, making it suitable 
    for mobile testing.

    Accessibility Testing: You can use Playwright to test the 
    accessibility of your web applications, ensuring that they 
    are usable by people with disabilities.

//////////////////

Use Cases:

    End-to-End Testing: Playwright is well-suited for testing 
    web applications from start to finish, simulating user 
    interactions and verifying the correctness of the application's 
    behavior.

    Integration Testing: You can use Playwright to test the 
    integration between different components of your web application.

    API Testing: Playwright can be used to test APIs by making 
    HTTP requests and verifying the responses.

    Visual Regression Testing: Playwright can help you identify 
    visual changes in your web application, ensuring that the 
    user interface remains consistent.
