Playwright comes with auto-wait built in meaning it waits for 
elements to be actionable prior to performing actions. Playwright 
provides assertThat overloads to write assertions.

Take a look at the example test below to see how to write a test 
using web first assertions, locators and selectors.

package org.example;

import java.util.regex.Pattern;
import com.microsoft.playwright.*;
import com.microsoft.playwright.options.AriaRole;

import static com.microsoft.playwright.assertions.PlaywrightAssertions.assertThat;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
            Browser browser = playwright.chromium().launch();
            Page page = browser.newPage();
            page.navigate("https://playwright.dev");

            // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
            assertThat(page).hasTitle(Pattern.compile("Playwright"));

            // create a locator
            Locator getStarted = page.getByRole(AriaRole.LINK, new Page.GetByRoleOptions().setName("Get Started"));

            // Expect an attribute "to be strictly equal" to the value.
            assertThat(getStarted).hasAttribute("href", "/docs/intro");

            // Click the get started link.
            getStarted.click();

            // Expects page to have a heading with the name of Installation.
            assertThat(page.getByRole(AriaRole.HEADING,
               new Page.GetByRoleOptions().setName("Installation"))).isVisible();
        }
    }
}

Assertions
Playwright provides assertThat overloads which will wait until 
the expected condition is met.

import java.util.regex.Pattern;
import static com.microsoft.playwright.assertions.PlaywrightAssertions.assertThat;

assertThat(page).hasTitle(Pattern.compile("Playwright"));

///////////////////

Locators
Locators are the central piece of Playwright's auto-waiting and 
retry-ability. Locators represent a way to find element(s) on 
the page at any moment and are used to perform actions on elements 
such as .click .fill etc. Custom locators can be created with 
the Page.locator() method.

import static com.microsoft.playwright.assertions.PlaywrightAssertions.assertThat;

Locator getStarted = page.locator("text=Get Started");

assertThat(getStarted).hasAttribute("href", "/docs/intro");
getStarted.click();

/////////////////

Playwright supports many different locators like role text, test id 
and many more. Learn more about available locators and how to pick 
one in this in-depth guide.

import static com.microsoft.playwright.assertions.PlaywrightAssertions.assertThat;

assertThat(page.locator("text=Installation")).isVisible();

////////////////////

Test Isolation
Playwright has the concept of a BrowserContext which is an in-memory 
isolated browser profile. It's recommended to create a new BrowserContext 
for each test to ensure they don't interfere with each other.

Browser browser = playwright.chromium().launch();
BrowserContext context = browser.newContext();
Page page = context.newPage();
