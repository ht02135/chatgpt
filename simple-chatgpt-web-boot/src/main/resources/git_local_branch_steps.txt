main branch (your existing branch) → create local feature branch → code + commits → merge back into that main branch.

Below are the clean steps (Windows path is fine).

0) Go to your repo folder
cd C:\worksplace\sts\chatgpt\simple-chatgpt-web-boot

1) Make sure your “main branch” is up to date
First, see what branch you’re on:
git status
git branch

Checkout the branch you want to base off (example: main or develop or whatever your main working branch is):
git checkout main

Pull latest change
git pull

2) Create a new local branch off that branch

Pick a good branch name, example: feature/add-login:
git checkout -b feature/add-login

This does:
create the branch
switch you to it

Confirm:
git branch

3) Do your code changes

Edit files, build, test, etc.

4) Commit your changes (as many commits as you want)

5) Merge your feature branch back into the main branch (LOCAL)

Switch back to main:
git checkout main

Make sure main is still updated (recommended):
git pull

Merge your feature branch:
git merge feature/add-login

6) Push the updated main branch to GitHub
git push

7) (Optional) Delete the local feature branch after merge
git branch -d feature/add-login
