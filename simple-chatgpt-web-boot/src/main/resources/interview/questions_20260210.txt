question about java.lang.OutOfMemoryError

A) java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

Most common. Heap is full.

Memory leak (objects accidentally retained)
Cache growing without bounds
Reading huge data into memory
Too many large objects

B) GC overhead limit exceeded
JVM is spending almost all CPU doing GC and freeing almost nothing.
Typical causes
Same as heap leak, just more severe

C) Metaspace
Class metadata area is full.
Typical causes
Dynamic class generation (Spring proxies, ByteBuddy, CGLIB)
hung-CGLIB spring proxies (load vs get)
Classloader leaks (common in app servers / redeploys)

D) Direct buffer memory
Off-heap (NIO direct buffers) is exhausted.
Typical causes
Netty / NIO direct buffers
Large direct ByteBuffers not released quickly enough

E) unable to create new native thread
Not heap. OS can’t create more threads.
Typical causes
Too many threads (thread leak)
OS limits (ulimit, container limits)

2) Don’t try to recover by catching OOM
You can catch OutOfMemoryError, but it’s usually a bad idea.
Why:
JVM may be in a corrupted state
Even logging may fail
You can easily cause more OOM inside the catch block

3) Turn on the right JVM diagnostics (this is the #1 real fix)

For production, always run with:

-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
-XX:HeapDumpPath=/path/to/dumps
-XX:ErrorFile=/path/to/hs_err_pid%p.log
-Xlog:gc*:file=/path/to/gc.log:time,level,tags

Then when OOM happens you get:
heap dump (.hprof) → find the leak
JVM error file → crash details
GC logs → memory trend

4) Find the leak (the real root cause)

Once you have a heap dump, use:
Eclipse MAT (most common)
VisualVM
YourKit / JProfiler
What you’re looking for:
“Dominators” / “retained size”
“Path to GC root”
Common leak patterns:
static Map / static List grows forever
caches with no eviction
ThreadLocal not cleared
listeners not removed
scheduled tasks holding references

question about java.lang.OutOfMemoryError

If you mean java.lang.StackOverflowError, that’s usually caused by infinite recursion

1) Infinite recursion (most common)

Example:
public int f(int x) {
    return f(x + 1);
}

2) Very deep recursion

Even if recursion is correct, it can be too deep:
DFS on huge graph
recursive tree traversal on deep tree
parsing large nested JSON/XML
recursive string building

How to fix it (real solutions)
Fix 1: Replace recursion with iteration

For DFS, use your own stack:

Deque<Node> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
stack.push(root);

while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
    Node n = stack.pop();
    // process n
    for (Node child : n.children()) {
        stack.push(child);
    }
}

This moves memory usage to heap (which is much larger than stack).

Fix 2: Fix cyclic toString()

This is super common.

Bad:

class User {
    List<Order> orders;
    public String toString() { return "User{orders=" + orders + "}"; }
}
class Order {
    User user;
    public String toString() { return "Order{user=" + user + "}"; }
}

Fix: only print IDs / small fields:

public String toString() {
    return "Order{id=" + id + ", userId=" + (user == null ? null : user.getId()) + "}";
}

-----------

Fix 3: Fix Jackson infinite recursion

If you have bidirectional relationships:

Use:

@JsonManagedReference / @JsonBackReference, OR

@JsonIgnore, OR

@JsonIdentityInfo

Example:

@JsonIgnore
private User user;

-------------

Fix 4: Don’t log whole object if it can recurse

Logging entire objects can trigger toString() recursion.

If you must log:

log IDs only

or log shallow fields

---------------

ix 5: Only as last resort: increase stack size

This is a band-aid, not a fix.

-Xss2m

If you need -Xss bigger, you almost always have a recursion design problem.

question about difference between class vs instance

A class is like a blueprint / recipe, and an instance is the actual thing you built from that blueprint.

Class

Defines what something is
Describes fields (data) and methods (behavior)
Exists as a definition, not a real “object” you can use directly (in most cases)

Instance (Object)

A real object created from a class
Has actual values stored in its fields
Multiple instances can come from the same class, but each can hold different data

Example:
myCar = new Car() (a specific car)

What’s happening here?

Car is the class
car1 and car2 are instances

Both are made from the same class, but:
car1.color is "Red"
car2.color is "Blue"

2>what is your biggest strength = tell me how you max match this role.

3>why you want to work here = answer with accomplishment

4>what is your salary requirements = use https://www.salary.com
early interview deflect salary question. 

do the range, according to my research, this type of role pays somewhere between x and y. do you agree?

salary is not concern at this stage, at this point i like to learn more about the role and team and product that the role gonna work on and week to week how is like to work in here.

lack of question = show no interest
can you tell what is 90days of this role?  
if person run into technical issue or domain knowledge issue, then is it red flag for this person to seek help in the team?
