What is Non-Functional Testing?

Non-Functional Testing is defined as a type of Software testing to check non-functional aspects (performance, usability, reliability, etc) 

Objectives of Non-functional testing

    Non-functional testing should increase usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability of the product.
    Helps to reduce production risk and cost associated with non-functional aspects of the product.
    Optimize the way product is installed, setup, executes, managed and monitored.
    Collect and produce measurements, and metrics for internal research and development.
    Improve and enhance knowledge of the product behavior and technologies in use.

Non-functional testing Parameters

1) Security:

The parameter defines how a system is safeguarded against deliberate and sudden attacks from internal and external sources. This is tested via Security Testing.
2) Reliability:

The extent to which any software system continuously performs the specified functions without failure. This is tested by Reliability Testing
3) Survivability:

The parameter checks that the software system continues to function and recovers itself in case of system failure. This is checked by Recovery Testing
4) Availability:

The parameter determines the degree to which user can depend on the system during its operation. This is checked by Stability Testing.
5) Usability:

The ease with which the user can learn, operate, prepare inputs and outputs through interaction with a system. This is checked by Usability Testing
6) Scalability:

The term refers to the degree in which any software application can expand its processing capacity to meet an increase in demand. This is tested by Scalability Testing
7) Interoperability:

This non-functional parameter checks a software system interfaces with other software systems. This is checked by Interoperability Testing
8) Efficiency:

The extent to which any software system can handles capacity, quantity and response time.
9) Flexibility:

The term refers to the ease with which the application can work in different hardware and software configurations. Like minimum RAM, CPU requirements.
10) Portability:

The flexibility of software to transfer from its current hardware or software environment.
11) Reusability:

It refers to a portion of the software system that can be converted for use in another application.
