Steps to Create Test Cases in Manual Testing

Letâ€™s create a Test Case for the scenario: Check Login Functionality

Step 1) A simple test case to explain the scenario would be
Test Case # 	Test Case Description
1 	Check response when valid email and password is entered

Step 2) Test the Data.
In order to execute the test case, you would need Test Data. Adding it below
Test Case # 	Test Case Description 	Test Data
1 	Check response when valid email and password is entered 	Email: guru99@email.com Password: lNf9^Oti7^2h

Step 3) Perform actions.
In order to execute a test case, a tester needs to perform a specific set of actions on the AUT. This is documented as below:
Test Case # 	Test Case Description 	Test Steps 	Test Data
1 	Check response when valid email and password is entered 	1) Enter Email Address

2) Enter Password

3) Click Sign in
	Email: guru99@email.com

Password: lNf9^Oti7^2h

Step 4) Check behavior of the AUT.
The goal of test cases in software testing is to check behavior of the AUT for an expected result. This needs to be documented as below
Test Case # 	Test Case Description 	Test Data 	Expected Result
1 	Check response when valid email and password is entered 	Email: guru99@email.com
Password: lNf9^Oti7^2h 	Login should be successful

During test execution time, the tester will check expected results against actual results and assign a pass or fail status
Test Case # 	Test Case Description 	Test Data 	Expected Result 	Actual Result 	Pass/Fail
1 	Check response when valid email and password is entered 	Email: guru99@email.com Password: lNf9^Oti7^2h 	Login should be successful 	Login was successful 	Pass
