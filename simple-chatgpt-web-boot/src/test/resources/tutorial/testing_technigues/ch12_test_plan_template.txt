////////////////

1.1.1) In Scope

Scope defines the features, functional or non-functional requirements of the software that will be tested

1.1.2) Out of Scope

Out Of Scope defines the features, functional or non-functional requirements of the software that will NOT be tested

.2) Quality Objective

Here make a mention of the overall objective that you plan to achive with your manual testing and automation testing.

Some objectives of your testing project could be

    Ensure the Application Under Test conforms to functional and non-functional requirements
    Ensure the AUT meets the quality specifications defined by the client
    Bugs/issues are identified and fixed before go live

1.3) Roles and Responsibilities

Detail description of the Roles and responsibilities of different team members like

    QA Analyst
    Test Manager
    Configuration Manager
    Developers
    Installation Team

2) Test Methodology
2.1) Overview

Mention the reason of adopting a particular test methodology for the project. The test methodology selected for the project could be

    WaterFall
    Iterative
    Agile
    Extreme Programming

2.2) Test Levels

Test Levels define the Types of Testing to be executed on the Application Under Test (AUT). The Testing Levels primarily depends on the scope of the project, time and budget constraints.

2.4) Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements

Suspension criteria define the criteria to be used to suspend all or part of the testing procedure while Resumption criteria determine when testing can resume after it has been suspended

2.5) Test Completeness

Here you define the criterias that will deem your testing complete.

For instance, a few criteria to check Test Completeness would be

    100% test coverage
    All Manual & Automated Test cases executed
    All open bugs are fixed or will be fixed in next release

3) Test Deliverables

Here mention all the Test Artifacts that will be delivered during different phases of the testing lifecycle.

Here are the simple deliverables

    Test Plan
    Test Cases
    Requirement Traceability Matrix
    Bug Reports
    Test Strategy
    Test Metrics
