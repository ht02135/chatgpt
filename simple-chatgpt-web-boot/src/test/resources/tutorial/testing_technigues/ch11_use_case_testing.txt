What is Use Case Testing?

Use Case Testing is a software testing technique that helps to identify test cases that cover entire system on a transaction by transaction basis from start to end. Test cases are the interactions between users and software application. Use case testing helps to identify gaps in software application that might not be found by testing individual software components.
