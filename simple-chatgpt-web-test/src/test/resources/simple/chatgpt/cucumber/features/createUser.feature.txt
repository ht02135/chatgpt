    Given I am on the users page
    And the user "testSelenium@yahoo.com" does not exist
    When I click the Create button
    And I am taken to the add user page
    And I enter the username "testSelenium@yahoo.com"
    And I enter the user key "testSelenium@yahoo.com"
    And I enter the first name "Test"
    And I enter the last name "Selenium"
    And I enter the email "testSelenium@yahoo.com"
