Feature: Edit user functionality
  As an admin
  I want to edit an existing user
  So that I can update their details when needed

  # Scenario will check: if user not exists, create first, then edit it
  Scenario: Edit an existing user
    Given I am on the users page
    When I search for the user "testSelenium@yahoo.com"
    And the user does not exist, I create a new user with username "testSelenium@yahoo.com"
    And I click Edit for the user "testSelenium@yahoo.com"
    And I update the first name to "Test updated" and last name to "Selenium updated"
    And I save the user
    Then the user "testSelenium@yahoo.com" should be present in the grid
